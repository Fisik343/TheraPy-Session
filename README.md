# TheraPy Session

I often find that I need to remember how to do some things when I don't work with Python or a certain module/library for a while. The goal of this repository is to serve as a reference for Python or specific libraries.

I'm also a TA in Penn State's Computer Science and Engineering department, so some of the content in here is designed to help benefit students who may not have much experience in Python.

At some point, I'll add a `requirements.txt` file.
